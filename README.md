# Your time is a valueable asset. Choose a company whose interview process excites you!

There's a massive disconnect between the interview process and the work you would be doing in the company on day to day basis. Interview process is one of the major problem in our industry which is broken but less often discussed or being worked upon. It's a problem for both the candidates and the companies.
* For candidates if the interview process is dehydrating they will lose interest half the way during the process and won't join the company because interview process also revelas the cultural aspect and the tech focus of the company.
* For companies they often miss on the good talent because of their legacy processes.

Jobs are a two way process **give and take** in which the candidates looking out for a job are not just looking for another company to work for just for the sake of money they look for the mutual relationship with the company where in they can contribute with their skills and help their own as well as the organisation's growth since they are planning to invest their valuable asset i.e **Time**.

There are few companies who have understood this and crafted their interview process so well and I believe they were able to change it because of the people within the organisation who have been part of old processes and felt it should be fixed.

**Rounds(approx)** - Total number of rounds. This an approximate number. Can vary depending on what role you're applying for.

**Scripted Questions** - Describes if the company asks questions which are kind of direct bookish questions or can be easily found on internet infact on the first result page on google ðŸ˜›. Example: Write a function to print first 100 fibonnaci numbers, How does event loop works, write a polyfil for X etc.

**DS and Algo** - Describes if the company asks DS and algo questions which which are kind of direct bookish questions about data structure and algorithms instead of a real life problem.

## Treebo Interview Process
| Rounds | Scripted Questions? | Typical DS and Algo Questions? | Live Coding?
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 5 | No | No | No
### Rounds Description 
1. **Exploratory Discussion:** This round is mostly about the candidate knowing the company and vice-versa. This gives clear idea to candidate if they are interested in the company and also let's the interviewer know if the candidate is interested in company's vision and goals.
2. **Technical Discussion:** This round is focussed more on what the candidate has done in their past. Based on this the interviewer asks few questions which reveals how much the candidate was involved in the projects they mentioned and also gives the glimpse about their technical skills.
3. **Problem Solving:** This round focusses on solving some real life problems unlike plain old DS algo round. During this round the interviewer plays the role of a product manager and gives the problem related to what the candidate would be doing in their day to day activity at work. Both of them brainstorm on the problem where the candidate describes the flow, design and architecture as they proceed and the interviewer keeps on asking questions and keep on enhancing the problem statement like a normal product manager would do.
4. **Take home assignment:** After the Problem Solving round is over the candidate is asked to take the problem that they discussed and implement the solution as an assignment task. Once they submit the assignment the code is reviewed by the interviewers and then the candidated is called to give a walk through of the code and also answering the queries during the call.
5. **Managerial Round:** This round is typically focussed on the cultural fitment of the candidate and compensation.
## Gatsby Interview Process
| Rounds | Scripted Questions? | Typical DS and Algo Questions? | Live Coding? |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 6 | No | No | Yes
### Rounds Description
1. **Cultural Fit:** The process starts with cultural fit round where (I personally really like this approach) the interviewer asks some basic set of questions which helps them identify whether the candidate will be a good fit for their team. This is interesting since if the candidate is not culturally fit then it doesn't makes sense to take it further and this saves time of both the parties.
2. **Technical Discussion:** This round is focussed more on what the candidate has done in their past, what are their aspirations etc. Based on this the interviewer asks few questions which reveals how much the candidate was involved in the projects they mentioned and also gives the glimpse about their technical skills. If the candidate has qualified this round they are given a gift voucher as a token for their time. I really respect Gatsby for this initiative!
3. **Pair Programming:** This round is focussed to assess the candidate's programming skills and how they perform in a time boxed environment. Depending on what team are you interviewing it could either be focussed on solving some half done PR, creating some design components etc.
4. **Mentoring:** If you're applying for a senior role you'll be asked to mentor a team member who are in their initial days of the career and you need to teach them some topics which would help them enhance their knowledge.
5. **Take home assignment:** Once the candidate has been qualified in all the above rounds they are given an assignment which is a paid project. Again appreciable initiative.
6. **Negotiation:** This round focusses on compensation discussion.

For the past few month I've been doing the research after I moved on from Treebo by personally giving interviews and I've curated a list of companies whose interview process amazed me and I believe are the ideal way of interviewing. 

I was honoured to get a chance to change the process at Treebo where we used to call it as **Candidate Driven Interview** process.

This site lists down the companies whose interview process are crafted well for frontend and you would enjoy talking up their interview process and would want to work with them
